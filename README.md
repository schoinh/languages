# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### _A web site to help the user determine which programming language to learn first, June 7, 2019_

#### By _**Na Hyung Choi**_

## Description

_This is a web site containing a quiz that helps the user determine which programming they should learn. There are five multiple-choice questions in addition to an input box for the user's name. Each question has 4 choices (A through D), and each choice corresponds to one of four programming languages (Swift, Python, F#, and C++). The web site tallies up the number of times the user has chosen A, and the number of times the user has chosen B, and so on, to determine which language may be most suited for the user. Upon submission, the user sees the results in a box below the "Go!" button. If the user clicks "Go!" without completely filling in the form (including the user's name), the browser will alert the user with a standard pop-up box._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the repository to your desktop and open index.html_
* _OR directly go to http://schoinh.github.io/languages ._

## Known Bugs

_If there is a tie between two languages, the result will suggest the language that comes earlier in this list (Swift, Python, F#, C++) instead of displaying both languages._
